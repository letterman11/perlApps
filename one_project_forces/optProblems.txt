1) define the problem
2) draw sketch
3) write primary equation
4) write secondary equation and rewrite primary in terms of first variable via the second equation
5) get first derivative and then critical points
6) get second derivative and find min/max
    positive -> concave down minimum
    negative -> concave up maximum 
    check for real world solution in original equation.


minimize rectangular open box => square base (x^2), rectangular sides (4xy)
---------------------------------------------------------------

S = x^2 + 4xy => Surface Area minimize
V = yx^2 = 4000cm3
y = 4000/x^2
    
x=10 y=20
