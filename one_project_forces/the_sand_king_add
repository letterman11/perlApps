an army of pebbles strewn across the horizon
marching toward the sea to meet Poseidon
a wave approaches blue splendored regaled with froth
the pebbles are swept back their efforts all for nought
the pebbles regroup from being scattered
march again against the blue matter
considering the blue wall and the mystery that it poses
humbling as it wills all who closes on the sea king's domain.

For as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God.
-- Romans 8:14 --
Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
-- I Corinthians 1:24b --
But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom,
 and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:
That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.
-- I Corinthians 1:30,31 --
For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain 
also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.
-- Acts 17:28 --

Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let 
the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches:
But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, 
that I am the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment, and righteousness, 
in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the LORD.
-- Jeremiah -- 9:23,24
