| THE POWER OF SUPPLIERS. 
---------------------------

Powerful suppliers capture more of the value for themselves by charging higher prices,
limiting quality or services, or shifting costs to industry participants. Powerful suppliers, including suppliers of labor,
can squeeze profi tability out of an industry that is unable
to pass on cost increases in its own prices. Microsoft, for instance, has contributed to the erosion of profi tability among
personal computer makers by raising prices on operating
systems. PC makers, competing fi ercely for customers who
can easily switch among them, have limited freedom to raise
their prices accordingly.
Companies depend on a wide range of different supplier
groups for inputs. 

A supplier group is powerful if:

1. It is more concentrated than the industry it sells to.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Microsoft’s near monopoly in operating systems, coupled
with the fragmentation of PC assemblers, exemplifi es this
situation.

2. The supplier group does not depend heavily on the industry for its revenues. Suppliers serving many industries
-----------------------------------------------------------
will not hesitate to extract maximum profi ts from each one.
If a particular industry accounts for a large portion of a supplier group’s volume or profi t, however, suppliers will want
to protect the industry through reasonable pricing and assist in activities such as R&D and lobbying.

3. Industry participants face switching costs in changing
-----------------------------------------------------------
suppliers. For example, shifting suppliers is diffi cult if companies have invested heavily in specialized ancillary equip-
ment or in learning how to operate a supplier’s equipment
(as with Bloomberg terminals used by fi nancial professionals). Or fi rms may have located their production lines adjacent to a supplier’s manufacturing facilities (as in the case
of some beverage companies and container manufacturers).
When switching costs are high, industry participants fi nd it
hard to play suppliers off against one another. (Note that
suppliers may have switching costs as well. This limits their
power.)

4. Suppliers offer products that are differentiated. Pharmaceutical companies that offer patented drugs with distinctive medical benefi ts have more power over hospitals,
-----------------------------------------------------------
health maintenance organizations, and other drug buyers,
for example, than drug companies offering me-too or generic products.

5. There is no substitute for what the supplier group provides. Pilots’ unions, for example, exercise considerable supplier power over airlines partly because there is no good
-----------------------------------------------------------
alternative to a well-trained pilot in the cockpit.

6. The supplier group can credibly threaten to integrate forward into the industry. In that case, if industry participants
-----------------------------------------------------------
make too much money relative to suppliers, they will induce
suppliers to enter the market.
