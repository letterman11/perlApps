| RIVALRY AMONG EXISTING COMPETITORS. 
-------------------------------------
Rivalry among existing competitors takes many familiar forms, including price discounting, new product introductions, advertising campaigns, and service improvements. High rivalry
limits the profi tability of an industry. The degree to which rivalry drives down an industry’s profi t potential depends, fi rst,
on the intensity with which companies compete and, second,
on the basis on which they compete.

The intensity of rivalry is greatest if:

1.  Competitors are numerous or are roughly equal in size and power. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
In such situations, rivals fi nd it hard to avoid
poaching business. Without an industry leader, practices desirable for the industry as a whole go unenforced.

2. Industry growth is slow. Slow growth precipitates fi ghts for market share.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Exit barriers are high. 
-------------------------------
Exit barriers, the fl ip side of entry
barriers, arise because of such things as highly specialized
assets or management’s devotion to a particular business.
These barriers keep companies in the market even though
they may be earning low or negative returns. Excess capacity
remains in use, and the profi tability of healthy competitors
suffers as the sick ones hang on.

4.  Rivals are highly committed to the business and have
aspirations for leadership, especially if they have goals that
go beyond economic performance in the particular industry.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
High commitment to a business arises for a variety of reasons.
For example, state-owned competitors may have goals that
include employment or prestige. Units of larger companies
may participate in an industry for image reasons or to offer
a full line. Clashes of personality and ego have sometimes
exaggerated rivalry to the detriment of profi tability in fi elds
such as the media and high technology.

5.  Firms cannot read each other’s signals well because of
lack of familiarity with one another, diverse approaches to
competing, or differing goals.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The strength of rivalry refl ects not just the intensity of
competition but also the basis of competition. The dimensions on which competition takes place, and whether rivals
converge to compete on the same dimensions, have a major
influence on profitability.
Rivalry is especially destructive to profi tability if it gravitates solely to price because price competition 
transfers profits directly from an industry to its customers. Price cuts are usually easy for competitors to see and match, making successive rounds of retaliation likely. Sustained price competition also trains customers to pay less attention to product
features and service.
Price competition is most liable to occur if:

   a)  Products or services of rivals are nearly identical and
there are few switching costs for buyers. This encourages
competitors to cut prices to win new customers. Years of airline price wars refl ect these circumstances in that industry.
   b)  Fixed costs are high and marginal costs are low. This
creates intense pressure for competitors to cut prices below
their average costs, even close to their marginal costs, to steal
incremental customers while still making some contribution
to covering fi xed costs. Many basic-materials businesses, such
as paper and aluminum, suffer from this problem, especially
if demand is not growing. So do delivery companies with
fi xed networks of routes that must be served regardless of
volume.
   c)  Capacity must be expanded in large increments to be
effi cient. The need for large capacity expansions, as in the
polyvinyl chloride business, disrupts the industry’s supplydemand balance and often leads to long and recurring periods of overcapacity and price cutting.
   d) The product is perishable. Perishability creates a strong
temptation to cut prices and sell a product while it still has
value. More products and services are perishable than is
commonly thought. Just as tomatoes are perishable because
they rot, models of computers are perishable because they 
soon become obsolete, and information may be perishable
if it diffuses rapidly or becomes outdated, thereby losing its
value. Services such as hotel accommodations are perishable
in the sense that unused capacity can never be recovered.
